#  Vehicle Speed Monitoring & Overspeed Analysis System

## Overview
This project analyzes vehicle speed data and identifies overspeeding vehicles
based on predefined speed limits. It automates data cleaning, classification,
and visualization for traffic monitoring use cases.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- SQL (conceptual / optional)
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## ⚙ Features
- Reads vehicle speed data
- Removes invalid / outlier values
- Classifies vehicles based on speed limits (80 & 100 kmph)
- Generates visual insights using charts

##  Use Case
- Traffic monitoring systems

- Note: Sample data is used for demonstration purposes.
In real-world deployment, data would be sourced from traffic sensors or a SQL database.

- Overspeed violation analysis
- Smart city traffic analytics

## ▶ How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
